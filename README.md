# 4th

# Geometric shapes calculations using C++ language.
# Appearently it's requird to apply 4 specific concepts on the code.
# Required concepts are "Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism".
# Geometric shapes are confined in: Oval, Square, Polygon, Circle, Ellipse, Rectangle, and Triangle.
# An Oval is actually an Ellipse, so it can be solved using the same formula.
# The main idea of the program is to use the mentioned concepts to find the circumference and the area of each shape, individually.
# It's silly that we are given this assignment without any introduction, or a real class lecture, so our only ally is the internet.
# The rediculous thing is that the subject teacher doesn't even reply to messages, leaving us in a desolate desert.
# Turned out this assignment is just .. easy, and isn't more than just using simple calculations along with classes.
# Making separate files for each part of the assignment.
# Finished writing code, and everything is working the way it is required and even better.
# Further updates may not happen, and if so, it'll depend on the subject teacher's POV.
# It is quite simple to use the program, and it only finds circumference and area, nothing else.
# In order to find them, program will ask you for some values, starting from one for the Circle, up to five for the Triangle.
