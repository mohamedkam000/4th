# 4th
# Geometric shapes calculations using C++ language.
# Appearently it's requird to apply 4 specific concepts on the code.
# Required concepts are "Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism".
# Geometric shapes are confined in: Oval, Square, Polygon, Circle, Ellipse, Rectangle, and Triangle.
# An Oval is actually an Ellipse, so it can be solved using the same formula.
# The main idea of the program is to use the mentioned concepts to find the circumference and the area of each shape, individually.
# It's silly that we are given this assignment without any introduction, or a real class lecture, so our only ally is the internet.
# The rediculous thing is that the subject teacher doesn't even reply to messages, leaving us in a desolate desert.
